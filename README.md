# CucumberJS with Gherkin scenarios in Protractor & Angular2

An example project to setup CucumberJS with Gherkin scenarios in Protractor & Angular2
As a base for the project I've used the amazing starting pack: https://github.com/AngularClass/angular2-webpack-starter

## Get started

```bash
# clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/samvloeberghs/protractor-gherkin-cucumberjs-angular2.git

# change directory to our repo
cd protractor-gherkin-cucumberjs-angular2

# install the repo with npm
npm install

# install TypeScript typings
npm run typings-install

# start the server
npm start

# run the tests
npm run ci
```
