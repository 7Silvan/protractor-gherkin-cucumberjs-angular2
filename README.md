# CucumberJS with Gherkin scenarios in Protractor & Angular2

An example project to setup CucumberJS with Gherkin scenarios in Protractor & Angular2
As a base for the project I've used the amazing starting pack: https://github.com/AngularClass/angular2-webpack-starter

## Get started

```bash
# clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/samvloeberghs/protractor-gherkin-cucumberjs-angular2.git

# change directory to our repo
cd protractor-gherkin-cucumberjs-angular2

# install the repo with npm
npm install

# install TypeScript typings
npm run typings-install

# start the server
npm start

# run the tests
npm run ci
```

## CucumberJS

Cucumber.js is a Cucumber implementation written in pure JavaScript. It runs on Node.js, IO.js, browsers and any other JavaScript platform.

## Gherkin scenarios

Gherkin is the language that Cucumber understands. It is a Business Readable, Domain Specific Language that lets you describe software’s behaviour without detailing how that behaviour is implemented.

Gherkin serves two purposes — documentation and automated tests. The third is a bonus feature — when it yells in red it’s talking to you, telling you what code you should write.
